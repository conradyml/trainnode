# trainnode
This repository is a NodeJS implementation that sends i2c signal to a PIC microcontroller, which send DCC signals to the model train track.

## Prereqs:
Node JS.
on Raspberry Pi W: need a NodeJS build to support ARM6. see: https://gist.github.com/mandrean/71f2cbf707025a5983c0fc04d78f3e9a
on other Raspberry Pi's, default NodeJS install is sufficeint.

## After Cloning:
run NPM Install in the trainnode directory to install node Dependnecies 

## ToDo:
Lots of things for this.
PIC code coming separately.
